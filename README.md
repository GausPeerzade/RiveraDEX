# Rivera Token Dex

Rivera Token Dex is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to add liquidity, swap Rivera Token (RVT) for Ether (ETH), and earn fees by providing liquidity to the RVT/ETH trading pair.


# Features

Add Liquidity: Users can contribute their RVT and ETH to the liquidity pool, allowing others to trade RVT against ETH on the DEX.
Swap Tokens: Users can swap RVT for ETH or vice versa directly on the DEX.
Earn Fees: Liquidity providers earn a share of the trading fees generated on the DEX based on their contribution to the liquidity pool.
Single Pair: Rivera Token Dex supports a single trading pair - RVT/ETH.
